In mathematics, a perfect number is an integer for which the sum of all its own positive divisors (excluding itself) is equal to the number itself. 
For example the number 6 is perfect, because 1+2+3 is equal to 6. Your task is to write a program that read integer 
numbers and print a message informing if these numbers are perfect or are not perfect.

Input
The input contains several test cases. The first contains the number of test cases N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Each one of the following N lines 
contains an integer X (1 ≤ X ≤ 108), that can be or not a perfect number.

Output
For each test case print the message “X eh perfeito” (X is perfect) or “X nao eh perfeito” (X isn't perfect) 
according with to above specification.
